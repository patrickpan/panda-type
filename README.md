# Panda Type 🐼
​
Panda typing app, deployed at https://panda-type.surge.sh
​
## Setting Up Locally
​
```sh
yarn
yarn watch
```
​
This will start a dev server at http://localhost:1234 – you can use this to access the app.
​
## Testing
​
```sh
yarn test
```
​
This will run all unit and integration tests. I wrote these using Jest and React Testing Library.
​
```sh
yarn cypress:open
```
​
I also have an E2E test set up for this project as well, using Cypress. If you have the dev server running, you can run the E2E test as well.
